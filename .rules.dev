## Goal

We are building an MCP server that is supposed to use the dvb api (via dvb-rs) to make requests to the dvb api.
The full range of the dvb-rs api is supposed to be covered.
We are aminig for optimal use of the mcp protocol.
The goal is to enable the user to talk to an llm based agent and ask it for directions, departure times, ETAs.
This is supposed to be a proper traffic guide.
