# implement a semantic route cache

We do not want to expose the entire route response directly to the AI agent as this would fill up too much of its context.
instead we want to build a sort of database/cache for routes that allows the MCP user to query with follow up questions.

for this we take the response of `pub async fn route_details<'a>(params: &Params<'a>) -> Result<DvbResponse<Routes>>` and semantically store it.
